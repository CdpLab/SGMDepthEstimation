## Modules

This project includes the following three key modules:

### 1. Patch Knowledge Distillation Module

The Patch Knowledge Distillation Module utilizes patch information to enhance the generalization and accuracy of the depth estimation model. By incorporating patch knowledge, the module learns depth information specific to regions within the scene.

### 2. Semantic Depth Consistency Loss

The Semantic Depth Consistency Loss improves the semantic consistency of depth images by integrating semantic information with depth prediction results. This enhancement aims to improve depth estimation accuracy and visual perception quality.

### 3. Block Self-Attention Mechanism

The Block Self-Attention Mechanism enhances the model's focus on different regions of the image using self-attention mechanisms. By dynamically adjusting attention weights learned automatically, the module enhances the accuracy and robustness of depth estimation.
